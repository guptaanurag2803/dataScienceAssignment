    "Boosting is a powerful machine learning ensemble technique aimed at improving model accuracy. It combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, into a strong predictive model. The process involves training learners sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessors. It assigns greater importance to misclassified instances, enabling subsequent models to focus on these cases.\n",
