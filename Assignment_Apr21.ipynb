    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance metrics in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) lies in the way they calculate distances between data points. Euclidean distance computes the shortest straight-line path between points in a multidimensional space, considering both magnitude and direction. Manhattan distance, however, calculates the sum of absolute differences along each dimension, resembling the distance traveled along city blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference can affect KNN's performance. Euclidean distance tends to be sensitive to varying scales across dimensions, while Manhattan distance is robust to scale differences. Depending on the dataset characteristics, using Euclidean distance might lead to features with larger scales disproportionately influencing neighbor selection. In contrast, Manhattan distance could provide more balanced results, particularly when dimensions have unequal importance or when scaling disparities exist, potentially leading to improved performance for KNN classification or regression tasks."
