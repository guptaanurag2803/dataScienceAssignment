    "The geometric interpretation allows us to visualize the effects of a matrix on different directions in space. For instance, in a 2D space, the eigenvectors point along the axes of stretching, and their corresponding eigenvalues dictate how much they stretch or compress. In 3D, the eigenvectors represent the axes of stretching, and their eigenvalues determine the degree of stretching along those directions.\n",

This technique enhances efficiency and generalization in face recognition tasks, and it's used in various security and authentication systems.\n",
