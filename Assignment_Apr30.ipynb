    "Homogeneity: Homogeneity measures how much each cluster contains only data points that belong to a single class or category in the original labels. A high homogeneity score indicates that the clusters are composed of mostly similar data points in terms of their true labels. It is calculated as the ratio of the conditional entropy of the cluster assignments given the true labels to the entropy of the true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness: Completeness measures how well all data points that belong to a single class or category in the original labels are assigned to the same cluster. A high completeness score indicates that all data points of a given class are assigned to the same cluster. It is calculated as the ratio of the conditional entropy of the true labels given the cluster assignments to the entropy of the true labels.\n",
    "\n",

    "The V-measure is a clustering evaluation metric that combines homogeneity and completeness to provide a balanced measure of how well a clustering algorithm performs. Homogeneity assesses whether each cluster contains only members of a single class, while completeness evaluates whether all members of a given class are assigned to the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The V-measure considers both of these aspects and provides a single score that represents the balance between them. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better clustering results. The V-measure can handle imbalanced cluster sizes and is more informative than using homogeneity or completeness individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the V-measure strikes a balance between the strengths of homogeneity and completeness, providing a comprehensive assessment of clustering quality that considers both the purity of clusters and the coverage of classes. This makes it a useful metric for evaluating clustering results, especially when dealing with complex datasets where class distributions might not be uniform across clusters."

A value near 0 implies that a data point is on or very close to the decision boundary between clusters, while a negative value suggests that the data point might be assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",

It helps in selecting the appropriate number of clusters and comparing different clustering algorithms or parameters.

    "Example: Consider a dataset of animals categorized into two classes, \"mammals\" and \"birds.\" A clustering algorithm incorrectly groups all mammals into one cluster and all birds into another cluster. In this case, the clusters are pure (high homogeneity) since each cluster contains only one class, but not all instances of the same class are in the same cluster (low completeness). This scenario showcases that a high homogeneity score doesn't necessarily guarantee high completeness, as some instances of a class might be scattered across different clusters."
