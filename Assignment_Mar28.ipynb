    "# Ridge regression shares several assumptions with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but it does not require all of the same assumptions.\n",
    "# The key assumptions of ridge regression include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Linearity:\n",
    "# The relationship between the predictors and the response variable should be linear.\n",
    "# Ridge regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the response, similar to OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Independence:\n",
    "# The observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "# This assumption assumes that there is no correlation or dependence between the observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Multicollinearity:\n",
    "# Ridge regression assumes the presence of multicollinearity, which is the high correlation among predictor variables.\n",
    "# It is specifically designed to handle multicollinearity by reducing the impact of highly correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "# The error terms should have constant variance across different levels of the predictor variables.\n",
    "# This assumption ensures that the variability of the errors is consistent throughout the range of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Normality:\n",
    "# Ridge regression assumes that the error terms follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "# This assumption is important for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and obtaining reliable p-values for the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "# While ridge regression makes these assumptions, it is generally considered to be more robust to violations of these assumptions compared to OLS regression.\n",
    "# This is because the regularization term helps stabilize the model and reduce the impact of violations such as multicollinearity. \n",
