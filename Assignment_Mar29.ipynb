    "# Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization or Lasso regularization, is a linear regression technique that introduces a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "# The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The key difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Ridge Regression, or Elastic Net Regression, lies in the penalty term.\n",
    "# Lasso Regression encourages sparsity by driving some of the coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "# This makes Lasso Regression a useful technique for feature selection, as it automatically selects a subset of the most important features and eliminates irrelevant or redundant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In comparison, OLS regression does not introduce any penalty term, Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) shrinks the coefficients towards zero without setting them exactly to zero, and Elastic Net Regression combines L1 and L2 regularization.\n",

    "# Lasso Regression's ability to perform feature selection makes it particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where there are many features, but only a subset of them are truly relevant for the prediction task.\n",

    "# The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and select the most relevant features for the prediction task.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Simplicity:\n",
    "# Lasso Regression simplifies the model by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating irrelevant features from the model.\n",
    "# This results in a simpler and more interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Improved Generalization:\n",
    "# By removing irrelevant or redundant features, Lasso Regression helps reduce overfitting and improves the model's generalization performance.\n",
    "# It focuses on the most informative features, allowing the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Computational Efficiency:\n",
    "# In high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features, Lasso Regression can significantly reduce the computational burden by effectively shrinking the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "# This makes it computationally efficient compared to other feature selection techniques that involve exhaustive search or combinatorial optimization.\n",
