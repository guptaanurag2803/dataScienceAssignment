    "# Elastic Net regression is a regression technique that combines the properties of Ridge regression and Lasso regression.\n",
    "# It is used to handle situations where there are multiple features in a dataset that may be highly correlated with each other, which can lead to multicollinearity issues in traditional regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Elastic Net regression, the objective function is a combination of the Ridge and Lasso penalties, resulting in a hybrid regularization term.\n",
    "# The hybrid penalty consists of two parts: the L1 penalty (Lasso) that encourages sparsity by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero, and the L2 penalty (Ridge) that encourages smaller coefficients overall.\n",
    "# By adjusting the mixing parameter, Elastic Net regression can control the balance between the two penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compared to other regression techniques, Elastic Net regression offers several advantages.\n",
    "# First, it can handle datasets with a large number of features and can automatically perform feature selection by shrinking irrelevant or redundant features to zero.\n",
    "# Second, it addresses the limitations of Ridge regression by allowing for variable selection.\n",
    "# Lastly, Elastic Net regression is particularly useful when there are highly correlated features present, as it can select one feature from a group of correlated features instead of picking all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, Elastic Net regression is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of Ridge and Lasso regression, providing flexibility in handling multicollinearity and performing feature selection in regression problems."

    "# Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net regression typically involves using a technique called cross-validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Split the dataset:\n",
    "# Divide your dataset into training and validation sets.\n",
    "# The training set will be used to train the Elastic Net model, while the validation set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 4. Model evaluation:\n",
    "# For each combination of alpha and lambda, compute the average performance metric (e.g., mean squared error) across all k folds in the inner loop.\n",
    "# This will give you an estimate of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Choose the optimal parameters:\n",
    "# Select the combination of alpha and lambda that yields the best performance metric.\n",
    "# This can be the combination with the lowest mean squared error or another suitable evaluation metric of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Train the final model:\n",
    "# Once you have determined the optimal parameters, train the Elastic Net model using these parameters on the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Evaluate on the validation set:\n",
    "# Finally, assess the performance of the trained model on the validation set to get an estimate of its performance on unseen data."
